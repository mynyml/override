= Summary

  Allows using the 'super' keyword with methods previously defined in reopened classes.
  Simple and elegant alternative to Rails' #alias_method_chain for redifining methods while keeping access to the previous definition.

= Examples

  class Post
    def text
      @text.strip

  class Post
    override :text

      super.reverse
    end
  end
